### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ˜„ I am Suman Basnet and I love the thrill of developing meaningful, reliable, robust and scalable software.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently working on several personal projects e.g. algo visualizer project, event-driven ecommerce architecture etc.
- ðŸ”­ Besides personal projects, Iâ€™m also currently looking at some open source softwares to contribute to.
- ðŸŒ± My current curiosity lies in event-driven architecture using even stores and also exploring Rust eco-system.
- ðŸ‘¯ Later down the line, Iâ€™m also looking to collaborate on Cloud Native, Blockchain and Rust projects, probably with event-driven architecture, Kafka and k8s.
